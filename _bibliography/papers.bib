  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the σ-antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)
estimator for a multi-dimensional diffusion which is an extended version of the original anti-
thetic MLMC one introduced by Giles and Szpruch. Our aim is to study the asymptotic
behavior of the weak errors involved in this new algorithm. Among the obtained results, we
prove that the error between on the one hand the average of the Milstein scheme without
Lévy area and its σ-antithetic version build on the finer grid and on the other hand the
coarse approximation stably converges in distribution with a rate of order 1. We also prove
that the error between the Milstein scheme without Lévy area and its σ-antithetic version
stably converges in distribution with a rate of order 1/2. More precisely, we have a functional
limit theorem on the asymptotic behavior of the joined distribution of these errors based on
a triangular array approach. Thanks to this result, we establish a
central limit theorem of Lindeberg-Feller type for the σ-antithetic MLMC estimator. The

  abstract = {The joint parametric estimation of the drift coefficient, the scale coefficient and the jump activity in stochastic differential equations driven by a symmetric stable Lévy process is considered, based on high-frequency observations.
Firstly, the LAMN property for the corresponding Euler-type scheme is proven and lower bounds for the estimation risk in this setting are deduced. When the approximation scheme experiment is asymptotically equivalent to the original one, these bounds can be transferred. Secondly, a one-step procedure is proposed which is shown to be fast and asymptotically normal and even asymptotically efficient when the scale coefficient is constant. The
performances in terms of asymptotical variance and computation time on samples of finite size are illustrated with simulations.}

We find significant bilateral interactions between Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok and between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. In specific, the air quality in Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok positively affects to each other. Besides, the air quality in Singapore positively drives the air quality in Kuala Lumpur, but the inverse relation is negative. These findings preliminary suggest bilateral environmental agreements among sub-regions of Southeast Asia.

We first show that the unnormalized estimator is consistent and that the normalizing random variable converges in L^4 to 1. Then, we deduce the consistency of the considered normalized estimator. The comparison in favor of the normalized estimator is obtained by the mean squared error. We conclude by providing, for the first time, the general asymptotic normalities through some regularity assumptions for both unnormalized and normalized associated-kernel density estimators. The Gumbel, Weibull, lognormal, and other associated kernels are investigated for illustrating theoretically and numerically some of our results with an application to original data of automobile claim amounts from Covéa Affinity. }

  abstract ={The drift sequential parameter estimation problems for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes under the limited duration of observation are studied. Truncated sequential estimation methods for both scalar and two-dimensional parameter cases are proposed. In the non-asymptotic setting, for the proposed truncated estimators, the properties of guaranteed mean-square estimation accuracy are established. In the asymptotic formulation, when the observation time tends to infinity, it is shown that the proposed sequential procedures are asymptotically optimal among all possible sequential and non-sequential estimates with an average estimation time less than the fixed observation duration. It also turned out that asymptotically, without degrading the estimation quality, they significantly reduce the observation duration compared to classical non-sequential maximum likelihood estimations based on a fixed observation duration. }

  abstract ={Lévy processes are known as an excellent tool for modeling price processes in mathematical finance. In particular, they form a central class of stochastic processes containing both Brownian motion and the Poisson process and are prototypes of Markov processes
and semi-martingales. An important feature for modeling price processes is that they
allow to model abrupt moves by jumps like Poisson process. In this thesis, some theories of Lévy processes needed for financial applications and different methods for pricing financial derivatives will be introduced. Popular models in the literature and their possible simulation techniques would be presented.}

  abstract = {In this paper we study parameter estimation problems for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes. For the first time for such models sequential estimation procedures are proposed. In the non-asymptotic setting, the proposed sequential procedures provide the estimation with non-asymptotic fixed mean square accuracy. For the scalar parameter estimation problems non-asymptotic normality properties for the proposed estimators are established even in the cases when the classical non sequential maximum likelihood estimators can not be calculated. Moreover, the Laplace transformations for the mean observation durations are obtained. In the asymptotic setting, the limit forms for the mean observation durations are founded and it is shown, that the constructed sequential estimators uniformly converge in distribution to normal random variables. Then using the Local Asymptotic Normality (LAN) property it is obtained asymptotic sharp lower bound for the minimax risks in the class of all sequential procedures with the same mean observation duration and as consequence, it is established, that the proposed sequential procedures are optimal in the minimax sens in this class.}

  abstract ={Motivated by the multilevel Monte Carlo method introduced by Giles, 2008 to improve the rate of convergence by the Monte Carlo method, we are interested in developing limit theorems for different settings. The thesis consists of three parts:
For the first part, we prove a central limit theorem on the Multilevel Monte Carlo
method for pricing vanilla type options when the underlying asset is given by an
exponential Lévy model. To prove this result we give a functional limit theorem on
the asymptotic behavior of the error distribution of the approximating process between
two consecutive levels of the Multilevel Monte Carlo method. Moreover we provide
an analysis of the time complexity and it turns out that the MLMC method reduces
efficiently the time cost compared to a classical Monte Carlo method and in some
particular cases for a given precision ε it reaches the optimal complexity O(ε−2) so
that it behaves like an unbiased Monte Carlo method. We illustrate the supremacy of
the MLMC method over the Monte Carlo methods through numerical tests for pricing
European call options under an exponential Lévy model where the Lévy process is
given by the CGMY model that covers a general class of Lévy processes.
For the second part, we study the asymptotic behavior of the normalized error
process between Euler approximations
with time steps 1/n and 1/nm of a given stochastic differential equation driven by
a pure jump Lévy process. In this paper, we prove that this multilevel error process
converges to some non-trivial limiting process with a sharp rate. The obtained
results extend those of Jacod, 2004. For the
multilevel error, the proofs of the current paper are challenging since unlike Jacod,
2004 we need to deal with m dependent triangular arrays instead of one. Formally,
when letting m tends to infinity, we recover limit processes of Jacod, 2004.
For the last part, we introduce our antithetic MLMC estimator for a multi-
dimensional diffusion which is an extended version of the original antithetic MLMC
one introduced by Giles and Szpruch, 2014. Our aim is to study the asymptotic be-
havior of the weak errors involved in this new algorithm. Among the obtained results,
we prove that the error between on the one hand the average of the Milstein scheme
without Lévy area and its antithetic version build on the finer grid and on the other
hand the coarse approximation stably converges in distribution with a rate of order
1. We also prove that the error between the Milstein scheme without Lévy area and
its antithetic version stably converges in distribution with a rate of order 1/2. More
precisely, we have a functional limit theorem on the asymptotic behavior of the joined
distribution of these errors based on a triangular array approach. Thanks to this
result, we establish a central limit theorem of Lindeberg-Feller type for the antithetic
MLMC estimator. The time complexity of the algorithm is carried out.}
